# Mapty

Mapty is a web app that users can use to track at what place they have worked out. It is built on a leaflet library and currently is only consisted of the frontend but I am planning to implement the backend as well making the website full stack and more complex.



## Authors
The website idea and first stage of development was done by Jonas Schmedtmann in the Udemy course The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert! However, I added additional features and refactored the code.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vstefan22/Mapty.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd mapty
```

As the website is not using any additional libraries and frameworks, simply start live server to run the website.
